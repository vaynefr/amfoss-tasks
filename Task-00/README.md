  ## TASK-00
  
  Installation of ubuntu was a really tough task for me.
  First issue i faced was my laptop only had one storarge device which was an ssd and it was encrypted with bitlocker ,but in control panel an option to disable it for my disk was not available like for others.And it took me 2 days of googling to find the way to disable it using CMD commands.
  The next issue i faced was,i was unable to partition my ssd because of the bitlocker .I could only partition 11gb for ubuntu installation.After disabling the bitlocker this was fixed.Next i faced a challenge of ubuntu getting stuck at loading screen.This was overcome by using the recovery mode.
